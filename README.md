# ScoreBoard
ScoreBoard is a small challenged, proposed by Scrimba. Built from scratch, using HTML, CSS and JS. The main purpose for making it was to consolidate the material of a JS module. You can add 1, 2 or 3 points at a time to each of the sides (Home and Guest). You can also start a new game.
